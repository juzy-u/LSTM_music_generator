# LSTM_music_generator
In this project, we will try an LSTM-based neural network for music generation.
As a dataset, we will not use standard library datasets, but will make our own. 
In this project, we will try to train a neural network on the songs of the Korol and Shut band.
Actually, we will make the dataset in the Guitar Pro midi editor.
Further, all steps will be described in the code.
